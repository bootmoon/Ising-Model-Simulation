# Ising Model
A Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model using the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm. Intended as a submission for the Capstone Project for Physics 77 at UC Berkeley. The goal of this project is to simulate and analyse in some detail, various nuances of the Ising Model, with sufficient clarity so that it may be of some instructional and pedagogical value to future 77 students interested in this project.
